# About
We are team ReBorn! Our focus is on enhancing the cooking experience. We aim to create a design that turns a two-handed activity in the kitchen into a one-handed task.

## Progress
Week 1 <br>
Teams were formed, and topics were distributed among the 8 teams.

Week 2 <br>
For the next several months we will be working closely with Carolee to design a product catered toward kitchen accessibility. <br>
Background on Carolee: <br>
Carolee is a retired school teacher and former avid cook who was diagnosed with Inclusion-Body Myositis (IBM), a form of muscular dystrophy 12 years ago. Her right arm is functional with limited strength, however we aim to harness this mobility and strength when creating a kitchen product with her! 

Week 3 <br>
In preparation for our first meeting with Carolee, we created a set of questions to ask both her and her husband Tom. These questions will focus on their experiences in the kitchen, and allow us to understand their daily routine and some pain points during the process

Week 4 <br>
Our first meeting with Carolee was incredibly insightful, and helped us narrow the scope of our project. We learned that she does not cook now, but still participates by reading recipes to Tom and guiding him through the process. Our next step will be to analyze all the information we obtained. Below are photos of her kitchen, as well as how she grips a spoon with her right hand. 
(Put those pictures here)

Week 5 <br>
Our goal this week was to create point of view statements that will help guide us as we continue to ideate. We asked ourselves: <br>
*How might we increase the scope of activities Carolee can do in the kitchen? <br>
How might we make cooking a daily hobby for Carolee? <br>
How might we make cooking a zero-handed process?* <br>
